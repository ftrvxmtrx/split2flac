See [unflac](https://github.com/ftrvxmtrx/unflac) as a possible replacement
in the (hopefully) nearest future.

split2flac
==========

**split2flac** splits one big APE/FLAC/TTA/WV/WAV audio image (or a collection of such files, recursively) with CUE sheet
into FLAC/M4A/MP3/OGG_VORBIS/OPUS/WAV tracks with tagging, renaming, charset conversion of cue sheet, album cover images.
It also uses configuration file, so no need to pass a lot of arguments every time, only an input file.
Should work in any POSIX-compliant shell.

**NOTE**: script is able to find cover image and cue sheet **automatically** (including internal ones).

Manual installation
-------------------

  * place ``split2flac`` somewhere (``/usr/bin`` or ``/usr/local/bin`` is fine)
  * create symbolic links to the same file like this:

        cd /usr/bin    # this is a directory where split2flac was installed
        ln -s split2flac split2mp3
        ln -s split2flac split2ogg
        ln -s split2flac split2opus
        ln -s split2flac split2m4a
        ln -s split2flac split2wav
